# HomeWeatherStation
This is software used to measure air quality using a Raspberry and BME680 sensor. The software was created using Deploy With Balena. The software can be used to read air temperature, humidity, air pressure and air quality values. The program is accessed via the Balena Cloud control panel. At the same time, Grafana is installed in the software, which visualizes the measured values in a more readable format. With Balena Cloud, the Grafana display panel can be published to a website created by Balena Cloud, which allows the display panel to be read remotely. In addition, an InfluxDB database is installed in which the measured values are stored. InfluxDB runs in the program locally.
